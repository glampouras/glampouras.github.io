- title: Short bio
  type: text
  contents: Gerasimos (Makis) Lampouras is a Principal Research Scientist and currently serves as the Team Leader of the Speech and Language group in Huawei Noah’s Ark Lab, London. <br><br> Areas of interest generally fall somewhere between Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning, with his latest efforts focused on improving the auto-regressive reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models. Recently this journey has led him to try and teach LLMs to generate / understand programming languages, while previously his work was more focused on Natural Language Generation, Dialogue Systems, and Machine Learning applications for Natural Language Processing. <br><br> Previously, he was a Research Associate at the University of Cambridge, University of Sheffield and University College London. He graduated and received his MSc and PhD from the Athens University of Economics and Business.
