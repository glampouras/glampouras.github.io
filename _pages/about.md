Hello there! :smirk_cat:	

I am a Principal Research Scientist and currently serve as the Team Leader of the Speech and Language group in Huawei [Noahâ€™s](https://www.linkedin.com/company/noah-s-ark-lab/) [Ark](https://github.com/huawei-noah) [Lab](https://www.noahlab.com.hk/#/about), London. If you are intersted in joining us, you can find information about open positions [here](https://huaweiuk.teamtailor.com/). **Also, keep in mind that spots for <ins>Research Internships</ins> are open all year round and you can apply through [here](https://huaweiuk.teamtailor.com/jobs/4209323-research-intern-nlp).**

My areas of interest generally fall somewhere between Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning, with my latest efforts focused on improving the auto-regressive reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models. Recently this journey has led me to try and teach LLMs to generate / understand programming languages, while previously my work was more focused on natural language generation, dialogue systems, and machine learning applications for NLP.

Previously, I was a research associate at the University of Cambridge, University of Sheffield and University College London. I graduated and received my MSc and PhD from the Athens University of Economics and Business.

In my spare time, I survive my cat and struggle to keep up with too many intestests, but I do enjoy reading fiction, playing games (board, video, and dungeon mastering TTRPGs), and (unfortunately rarely) paint.
